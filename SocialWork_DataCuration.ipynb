The maximum number of records that can be extracted is 10,000.  Thus, the search results were sorted in the web interface from newest to oldest, and then the extraction was made.  Thus, 33 articles were not retaiend, but these are the oldest records that will not be used in our current work.  Additonally the current cleaning script also excludes all articles publised before 2014.  The extract from PubMed was in a standard RIS format (\\*.nbib).

For this pull, I extracted article records with all the cited references.  In doing so, the extract batch limit was 500, whereas the article records without the cited references allows for batches of 1,000.  The files were saved in a RIS format, which is used by bibliogrphy managers, like Zotero and EndNote.  To process these files, we used a Python module called `RISparsers`.
